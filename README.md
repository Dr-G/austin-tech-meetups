# Austin Tech Meetups
### A comprehensive list of Austin Tech Meetups with Codes of Conduct

After cataloging over 50 popular Austin Tech Meetups, I have found only about ~27% have a Code of Conduct. Codes of Conduct are important to create more diverse and inclusive communities. 

Please see how you help and contribute in the [What can I do?](#what-can-i-do) and [Contributions](#contributions) sections

## What can I do?

If you are an organizer or part of a meetup that is not listed here and don't have a Code of Conduct, **please** bring it up with the organizers of the meetup. If you are wanting to be an ally of underrepresented groups in tech, this is a good first step. 

I'm also open to helping you establish a Code of Conduct within your meetup. 

## Resources

Ashe Dryden has created a comprehensive page of [Code of Conduct resources](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq). If you are looking for why your organization or meetup needs a Code of Conduct or have other questions related to Code of Conducts, I highly recommend it.

TODO: Add more resources

## Contributions

If you would like submit a pull request adding a meetup that has a Code of Conduct, I will happily accept. 

I am also looking for PRs that has links directly to the Code of Conducts for each meetup and more Code of Conduct resources, especially around Reporting Guidelines.
